# ChocoBot üç´
> A Work In Progress Osu related Discord bot. 

**If you want to invite the bot to your server** : [Link here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=893457417675886602&permissions=534723815488&scope=bot) 

I will update this GitHub repo as the project goes on and according to my progress !

## Setup üåå :

### Git clone :
>Before doing anything, you will have to get your local version of the bot (you will need both nodeJS and git). To do so :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amnezziaa/ChocoBot.git
cd ./ChocoBot/
npm install
```
### Create your discord bot, your mongoDB server and fill in the env file :

> You will then have to create a discord bot application, setup a mongoDB server and copy all the needed infos in a .env file. You can copy the example.env file content and replace the void with your values.

### Create your token.json file in osuApi :
> Copy the tokenExample.json file and rename it to token.json.

### Run the bot :
> You can now execute the command `node .` in the directory which should launch the bot. If you encounter a problem, you can try to contact me on discord : Amnezzia#3632
