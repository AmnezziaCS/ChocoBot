# üç´ ChocoBot :
> A Work In Progress Osu related Discord bot. 

I will update this GitHub repo as the project goes on and according to my progress !

## üåå Setup :

### Git clone :
>Before doing anything, you will have to get your local version of the bot (you will need both nodeJS and git). To do so :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/amnezziaa/ChocoBot.git
cd .\ChocoBot\
npm install
```
### Create your discord bot, your mongoDB server and fill in the env file :

> You will then have to create a discord bot application, setup a mongoDB server and copy all the needed infos in a .env file. You can copy the example.env file content and replace the void with your values.

### Create your token.json file in osuApi :
> Copy the tokenExample.json file and rename it to token.json.

### Run the bot :
> You can now execute the command `node .` in the directory which should launch the bot. If you encounter a problem, you can try to contact me on discord : Amnezzia#3632
